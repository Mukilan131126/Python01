##a='''The Paper Bag Princess by Robert Munsch
##Elizabeth is a princess, and she is all set to marry Prince Ronald when he gets kidnapped by a terrible dragon.
##Elizabeth goes on a quest to rescue her prince. It seems like a fairly ordinary fairy tale, but once Elizabeth
##sets Ronald free, he tells her she does not look enough like a princess for him. Instead of getting upset, she
##decides someone as rude as that is not worth marrying, and she goes off on her own! This story sends a powerful
##message about independence and is a great read for young girls in particular, and the twist ending will surprise
##and delight all young readers. '''
